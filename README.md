# Development

For development of this project, I used [React](https://reactjs.org/), as for routing links I used [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6)

I developed the CSS styling with [Styled Componenets](https://styled-components.com/), which allowed me to keep all the styling and the JSX code in one file, instead of referencing multiple. Uses Sass nesting for CSS styling.

Animation transitions were accomplished using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/docs/).

Carosel was created using [Splidejs](https://splidejs.com/documents/)

Icons were sourced from [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)

For the API used in this application, I used the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs)
